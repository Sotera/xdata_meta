Initially, it is a version of the SMILE library, as in SMILE With Integrated Distributed Execution. The general approach has been to provide an API similar to the existing API SMILE developers use to build \"local\", single-threaded applications. However, we provide \"vectorized\" operations that hide a Hadoop-distributed implementation. Apart from invoking a few idioms like generic Hadoop command line argument parsing, these appear to the developer as if they were executed locally.",

In Blaze, computations are described in a high-level language (Python) but executed on a low-level runtime (outside of Python), enabling the easy mapping of high-level expertise to data without sacrificing low-level performance.

This is most often mediated by geometric entities (such as circles, squares and text) but always involves pixels eventually to display. In most systems, the pixels are tucked away under levels of abstraction in the rendering system. Abstract Rendering takes the opposite approach: expose the pixels and gain powerful pixel-level control. This pixel-level power is a complement many existing visualization techniques. It is an elaboration on rendering, not an analytic or projection step, so it can be used as epilogue to many existing techniques._x000D_\n_x000D_\nIn standard rendering, geometric objects are projected to an image and represented on that image's discrete pixels. The source space is an abstract canvas that contains logically continuous geometric primitives and the target space is an image that contains discrete colors. Abstract Rendering fits between these two states. It introduces a discretization of the data at the pixel-level, but not necessarily all the way to colors. This enables many pixel-level concerns to be efficiently and concisely captured.",
